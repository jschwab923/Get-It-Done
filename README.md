Not your average to-do list.

When we try to multitask we almost always end up producing less quality work, and actually being less productive.

Get It Done helps keep you focused on one task at a time so that you can actually get more things done, and produce the best possible work. By focusing on one task at a time, and breaking it down into small achievable goals you will find yourself getting more done than ever.

Whether your trying to get more done at work, make progress on the novel you've been meaning to write, or finally finish that painting that's sitting in your room, Get It Done will help you get it done.
